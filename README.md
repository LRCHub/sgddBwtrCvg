[00:08.39] There's an answer out there somewhere
[00:10.22] When the Muses whisper "truth or dare?"
[00:12.46] The hands of fate play tug-of-war
[00:14.27] But no one's keeping score
[00:16.22] Stay the course and be tenacious
[00:18.25] 'Cause the future is a game of chance
[00:20.45] The chips are down, but I'm all in
[00:22.20] I play until I win
[00:24.58] I'm not gonna give up now
[00:26.32] The wheels of fortune circle back around
[00:28.55] A new turn in the betting ring
[00:30.40] A maze of outcomes drawn in golden string
[00:32.75] And through this tangled thread
[00:34.24] I see what's up ahead
[00:36.32] A wild chase, a frantic pace
[00:38.43] I got to try my luck, I'm spinning fate
[00:43.64] Ah, la-da-da-da-da
[00:47.16] I'm always spinning fate
[00:51.69] Woah, yeah
[00:56.37] Spin the roulette, see where it falls
[00:58.56] Testing the limits and betting it all
[01:00.40] 'Round and around, jumping into the circle
[01:02.52] Over and over, a test of will
[01:04.12] Oh, the game is never easy
[01:06.25] And the outcome is a mystery
[01:08.42] But these are fates worth betting on
[01:10.29] Their threads unbroken
[01:12.52] Called to life
[01:14.18] By flaxen string
[01:15.92] Casting lots together
[01:17.95] At the start of everything
[01:20.59] I'm not gonna give up yet
[01:22.24] I spin back 'round with every chance I get
[01:24.76] The wheel turns and the die is cast
[01:26.53] The time has come for fate to change at last
[01:28.65] And if it's black or red
[01:30.26] I'm moving up ahead
[01:32.23] A perfect chance, a daring dance
[01:34.40] I'll spin this thread of fate with my own hands
[01:39.75] Ooh, la-la-la
[01:42.81] I'm taking fate into my hands
[01:47.67] Woah, yeah
[01:52.95] And through this tangled thread
[01:54.23] I see what's up ahead
[01:56.47] And through this tangled thread
[01:58.16] I see what's up ahead
